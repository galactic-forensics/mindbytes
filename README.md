# Mind Bytes

These are Jupyter Notebooks
that go with the Mind Bytes articles
published on the Galactic Forensics Website.
Here is a direct link to all articles:

The `requirements.txt` file presents
the minimum requirements that are necessary for most notebooks.
Further, more extensive requirements
might be directly inserted into the notebooks.

These notebooks are all tested to run with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
